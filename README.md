# 7Hearts

Inspired from the raid encounters of MMOs, this concept slice has you shooting and bombing while doding midair to evade the unslaught of enemies that come your way. Aiming, weaving and managing your resources allowed for a standard experience with my own twist, which was fun to work on.

Implemented a state machine, a rigidbody based player movement system, Srciptable Object based Weapons and A realized boss encounter.
